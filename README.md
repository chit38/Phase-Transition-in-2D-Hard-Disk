# Phase Transition in 2D Hard Disk using monte-carlo simulation
In this project we studied the phase transformation of 2D hard disk fluid. We Plotted radial distrubution function at various densities. We studied the equation of state by plotting beta*p/rho against rho and thus identified region of phase transformation.
